# genderBR 1.1.0

In this minor release, the genderBR package was improved in two ways. First, bugs and some minor issues were fixed, making the package's functions more stable. Second, the package now contains an internal dataset with all the names reported by the IBGE's Census that is used by the get_gender function to predict gender from Brazilian first names. Therefore, classifying a vector with more than 1,000 names takes no more than a few seconds now. Overall, these are the improvements:

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added input checks to the `get_gender` function.
* Reduce the time between requests to the IBGE's Census API.
* Fixed a problem on vectorization in the internal `round_guess` funcion.
* Included an internal dataset with all Brazilian first names and their predicted gender extracted from the IBGE.
* Update the `get_gender` function to work with internal data.
